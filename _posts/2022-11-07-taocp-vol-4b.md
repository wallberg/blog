I'm pleased to announce that I've received my copy of The Art of Computer Programming: Volume 4b, Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 2 {% cite knuthArtComputerProgramming2022 %}. Donald Knuth has been working on this [multi-volume set since 1962](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming) and is still going strong. Volume 4A began his treatment of combinatorial algorithms, which 4B continues by introducing backtrack programming. In 4B he covers dancing links and satisfiability with plans to continue coverage of backtrack programming in Volume 4C.

Before publishing each volume Knuth has been publishing paperback fascicles with sections of the book available for preview. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic I had recently received my copy of Fascicle 5, covering the introduction to backtrack programming and also dancing links. Finding myself locked down and with additional time on my hands I realized I could help proof the fascicle by implementing the algorithms and working through the exercises and their answers. During the next year I contributed feedback on improvements and typos in the fascicle to Don and received some honorary award checks for those which were accepted.

I'm so honored to have been able to contribute, in some small way, to this seminal work in computer science and to have my name listed at Don's [Bank of San Serriffe](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/boss.html) award page.
