In this post I present a summary of my understanding and takeaways from the book Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origins of Species {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 %}.

The authors are Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan. [Lynn Margulis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Margulis) was a microbiologist and evolutionary theorist. [Dorion Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorion_Sagan) is a science writer, essayist, and theorist. This book is one of a number of books co-authored by this mother-son team.

I found this book a delightful read. The authors beautifully and in detail describe very complex biological systems. Their theory is quite amazing, and it was very exciting to be reading this book, with presents a theory which is as much on the cutting edge today as the theory of natural selection was in its time, as presented by Charles Darwin in the Origin of Species {% cite darwinOriginSpecies1859 %}. The difficulty in writing this review was determining what information to include to keep it concise, as so many details and examples are necessarily omitted.

## Forward and Preface

The opening quote immediately provides us the author's view of the scope and magnitude of this book.

> Anyone whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory. Charles Darwin - The Origin of Species - 1859. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l x %}

The new theory is both radically different from the prevailing theories and contains gaps in evidence and understanding. And just as in the *Origin of Species*, it is backed by volumes of evidence that goes against that prevailing thinking, including that of evolutionary theorists. The forward is provided by [Ernst Mayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mayr), another well known evolutionary biologist, who says:

> Give the author's dedication to their special field \[microbiology], it is not surprising that they sometimes arrive at interpretations others of us find arguable. Let the readers ignore those that are clearly in conflict with the findings of modern biology. Let him concentrate instead on the authors' brilliant new interpretations and be thankful that they have called our attention to the worlds of life that, despite their importance in the household of nature, are consistently neglected by most biologists. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l xiii %}

I found this unexpectedly compelling. Mayr was willing to recommend the book but also say he felt parts of it are wrong. The authors accepted this characterization in their book. This serves to highlight the cutting edge nature of book. But I appreciate seeing the civility between scientists who disagree, which does not always occur.

> In this book we argue that to understand the true complexity of life--the main source of evolutionary novelty Charles Darwin sought--one must understand how organisms come together in new and fascinating ways, and how species, and speciation itself, evolved through the acquisition of genomes. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l xv %}

## Part One. The Evolutionary Imperative

The book begins by explaining the difference between Darwinism and Neo-Darwinism.

Darwin presented a theory of natural selection based on descent with modification.

* *Natural selection* - a way to express the concept that most life does not persist through time

* *Differential survival* - biotic potential, the maximal number of offspring possible for a given species, is seldom reached, so only some offspring survive to produce their own offspring

* *Descent with modification* - variations occur among offspring, and differences among organisms are selected by the environment through differential survival

However, Darwin did not know the source of inherited variation and does not address speciation, the change from one species to another.

*Modern synthesis* was the science (1930-1960) invented to unite Darwin's idea that organisms and populations gradually change with Gregor Mendel's concept of genetic stasis. Neo-Darwinism and the modern synthesis attributed change to random mutation over long periods of time. The authors contend that DNA base changes and mutations play a role in the evolutionary process but is not the central role, contrary to neo-darwinist dogma.

The authors review the various concepts of species used by scientists, but propose their alternative based on *symbiogenesis*, "long-term stable symbiosis that leads to evolutionary change", {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l 12 %}, which broadens the concept to include all organisms.

> If organism A belongs to the same species as organism B, then both are composed of the same set of integrated genomes, both qualitatively and quantitatively. All organisms that can be assigned to a unique species are products of symbiogenesis. That is, because A and B share the same number of the same different kinds of integrated genomes they are assigned to the same species. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l 6 %}

Surprisingly, random mutation is widely held to drive speciation, but in actuality best describes the evolutionary process in bacteria, which lack species because they are the only organisms which are not products of symbiotic integration of formerly independence cells.

The new definition expands beyond macro, sexually-reproducing organisms (?includes smaller, asexually reproducing, protoctist, etc.?), but excludes bacteria.

## Part Two. The Microbe in Evolution

In this section the authors make the case for the importance of microbes (tiny organisms not visible to the naked eye) in evolution and the history of the heritable.  Metabolism is the set of self-maintaining chemical reactions an organism conducts to maintain itself. Bacteria have at least *twenty* metabolic modes not found in animals and plants.  To vastly oversimplify: animals have heterotrophy (oxygen to respire organic food molecules). Plants are also heterotrophic and add photoautotrophy (carbon dioxide-fixing, oxygen-producing photosynthesis). Bacteria can breathe sulfur or arsenic, transform metallic ions to metal precipitates, photosynthesis without oxygen, transform carbon dioxide and hydrogen to methane, breathe methane, etc. These basic capabilities from bacteria drive all life on earth through various forms of association.

Organisms form associations of all kinds. "Under stress, different kinds of individuals, of very different origins and abilities, often physically associate" {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l 90 %}. These associations sometimes persist over time, dissolve, become corporate mergers, or fuse to become a single new entity. Symbiotic partners can be integrated at different levels: behavioral (by being in physical proximity), metabolic (by exchange of waste and food), gene-product association (protein level dependence), and genetic (merging of genes into a new organism).

## Part Three. Planetary Legacy

This section reviews the planetary legacy of life through space and time. We first review how humans have become increasingly specialized in our activities over time. And the authors say "This trend toward increasing specialization is not limited to humans. Specialization increases in ecosystems as they develop". Cells have increased in specialization and their associations have become more specialized and complex. And we can trace the lineage of the complex physiology of human beings back through time:

> \[...] we come from symbiotic microbes, from nucleated specialized cells, from wormlike and lungfishlike animals, from reptiles and insectivores, prosimians and anthropoid apes--from form upon form. At no time in the past since the first life began did our lineage or the system itself ever die. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l 127 %}

Next we are introduced to Vladimir Vernadsky, a scientist who asserted and demonstrated that life is not made up of special matter, as commonly believed at the beginning of the 20th century, but of ordinary matter, primarily salty water and complex minerals.  All life, including humans, are composed of the same materials as the planet itself. While Darwin's legacy is that of connectedness of life through time, Vernadsky's legacy is the connection of life through space.

So if all life on the planet is connected and life is made up of the same material as the planet, how are life and the planet connected? Next we meet James Lovelock who introduced the Gaia Hypothesis, that the living and non-living components of the Earth's spheres affect each other. By spheres, I mean biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, etc. The non-living matter is not static; it wasn't the way it is in the past, the life helped shaped it in the same way it has shaped the life. Life is composed of minerals and chemicals and water, and life regulates itself, so the planet, composed of many entangled spheres is organism-like in many ways. The authors contend his hypothesis now has enough evidence to be considered a Theory.

{% include note.html content="QUOTE p 68: The simple but important assertion made in this chapter is that the natural selector is Gaia. Gaia, the biosphere, is best understood as the whole Earth's surface of interacting conditions and the biota, living matter, naturally organized into ecosystems. \"Biota\" or total biomass refers to flora, fauna, and microbiota taken together. Natural selection is one of the means by which Gaia, the self-regulating system, maintains itself as a dynamic but stable entity." %}

Here are some of the ways this regulation occurs:

* Soil would not exist without biological activity (e.g. worms, etc.)
* Calcium is a toxic waste which is recycled into organisms with shells and bones.
* Life removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thus cooling the Earth and preventing the atmosphere from evaporating away.
* Life flourished before the oxygenated atmosphere which created the oxygen in the atmosphere. Then new life evolved to make use of the oxygen.

The authors say Gaia could be called "Earth as a homeostatic chemical system", or "a giant ecosystem", but Gaia is a good choice because it is memorable and conveys the organism-like nature of the Earth's biosphere, though it is not considered an actual organism.

Next, we explore "eukaryosis in an anoxic world", that is the transition from bacteria with no nucleus (prokaryotes) in a world without oxygen in the environment to much larger, more complex cells with nuclei (eukaryotes) in an oxygenated environment. These eukaryotic cells make up all non-bacterial life on the planet. Per the authors, this change represents the largest discontinuity in the history of life and is connected to the origins of species. And thus we arrive at ?a restatement? of their theory:

> Our new definition of species, that organisms with the same number and kind of integrated genomes in common belong to the same species, depends on the recognition that all nucleated organisms are composite. All are products of integrated symbionts. The idea is that if two organisms (individuals) are members of the same species, then they are composed of precisely the same set of symbionts. Since bacteria are not formed by integration of symbionts, they lack species. The advantage of our analysis is that all nucleated organisms are assignable to species whether or not they ever engage in sex. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l 142 %}

* bacteria
* bacteria unite to form first eukaryotes, first species

## Part Four. Consortia

{% include note.html content="Does this section discuss how during times of non-stasis different species may 'consort' by becoming desperate enough to try to mate, and occasionally succeed despite the low probability of doing so?" %}

## Conclusion

In the forward, what were Ernst Mayer's objections?

> The authors refer to the act of symbiogenesis as an instance of speciation. Some of their statements might lead an uninformed reader to the erroneous conclusion that speciation is always due to symbiogenesis. This is not the case. Speciation--the multiplication of species--and symbiogenesis are two independent, superimposed processes. There is no indication that any of the 10,000 species of birds or the 4,500 species of mammals originated by symbiogenesis. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l xii %}

And

> Another of the authors' evolutionary interpretations is vulnerable as well. They suggest that the incorporation of new genomes in cases of symbiogenesis restores the validity of the time-honored principle of inheritance of acquired characteristics (what is called "Lamarckian inheritance"). This is not true. The two processes are entirely different. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l xiii %}

One of the authors' points is that the hypothesis for speciation through slow, random genetic mutation and drift has been shown to be false. We've never been able to see mutations which are beneficial and the fossil record is full of punctuated equilibrium. The authors seem to me to make a strong case for their theory based the information we do have.

{% include note.html content="Could the authors be suggesting that symbiogenesis is a precursor/foundation for speciation, rather than an immediate cause? There is also no indication that any species originated by slow, random mutation and drift." %}
