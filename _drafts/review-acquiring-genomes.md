In this post I present a summary of my understanding and takeaways from the book Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origins of Species {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 %}.

The authors are Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan. [Lynn Margulis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Margulis) was a microbiologist and evolutionary theorist. [Dorion Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorion_Sagan) is a science writer, essayist, and theorist. This book is one of a number books co-authored by this mother-son team.

I found this book a delightful read. The authors beautifully and concisely describe very complex biological systems. Their theory is quite amazing and it was very exciting to be reading this book, with presents a theory which is as much on the cutting edge today as the ??theory of natural selection?? Origin of Species was in its time. The opening quote is a harbinger of the scope and magnitude of this book:

> Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory. Charles Darwin - The Origin of Species - 1859. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l x %}

In other words, this theory is both radically different from the prevailing theories and still has a ??great many holes??, and just as in the *Origin of Species*, it is backed by volumes of evidence that goes against prevailing thinking, including that of evolutionary theorists. Amazingly in the forward, [Ernst Mayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mayr), another well known evolutionary biologist, rightly extols the virtues of the book but also says:

> The authors refer to the act of symbiogenesis as an instance of speciation. Some of their statements might lead an uninformed reader to the erroneous conclusion that speciation is always due to symbiogenesis. This is not the case. Speciation--the multiplication of species--and symbiogenesis are two independent, superimposed processes. There is no indication that any of the 10,000 species of birds or the 4,500 species of mammals originated by symbiogenesis. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l xii %}

%{ include note.html content="Could the authors be suggesting that symbiogenesis is a precursor/foundation for speciation, rather than an immediate cause? " %}
and

> Another of the authors' evolutionary interpretations is vulnerable as well. They suggest that the incorporation of new genomes in cases of symbiogenesis restores the validity of the time-honored principle of inheritance of acquired characters (what is called "Lamarckian inheritance"). This is not true. The two processes are entirely different. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l xiii %}

and

> Give the author's dedication to their special field \[microbiology], it is not surprising that they sometimes arrive at interpretations others of us find arguable. Let the readers ignore those that are clearly in conflict with the findings of modern biology. Let him concentrate instead on the authors' billiant new interpretations and be thankful that they have called our attention to the worlds of life that, despite their importance in the household of nature, are consistently neglected by most biologists. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l xiii %}

I found this unexpectedly compelling. Mayr was willing to recommend the book but also say he felt parts of it are wrong. The authors accepted this characterisation in their book. This setof the cutting edge this book. But I appreciate seeing the civility between scientists who disagree, which does not always occur.

## Summary

> In this book we argue that to understand the true complexity of life--the main source of evolutionary novelty Charles Darwin sought--one must understand how organisms come together in new and fascinating ways, and how species, and speciation itself, evolved through the acquisition of genomes. {% cite margulisAcquiringGenomesTheory2002 -l xv %}

*Origin of Species* about a number of topics, but not speciation, or the change from one species to another. Natural Selection, Descent with Modification, number of generated offspring v. reproducing offspring. This is Darwinism which continues to be valid.

Neo-Darwinism, mechanism of evolution, and therefore speciation, is random mutation over long periods of time. No evidence for this.

bacteria - no speciation
bacteria combined to create more complex eukaryotes, thus creating speciation
