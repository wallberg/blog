In this post I present a summary of my understanding and takeaways from the book _The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence For Belief_ {% cite collinsLanguageGodScientist2006 %} by [Francis S. Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins). Collins led the [Human Genome Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project) and was the director of the National Institutes of Health for 12 years.

## Part One: The Chasm Between Science and Faith

The author begins by detailing his childhood in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. He was raised by his parents without any importance give to faith. Later as a medical student he witnessed a great deal of pain and suffering, but also calm and peace by believers, particularly by one patient who challenged him to share what he believed.  In an attempt to answer that question he found his way to _Mere Christianity_ by C.S. Lewis.  In his reading of this and other sources, one of the most resonant concepts was the "Moral Law" described by Lewis.  Humans have a universal, built-in understanding of an absolute right and wrong, which must come from outside the system.
